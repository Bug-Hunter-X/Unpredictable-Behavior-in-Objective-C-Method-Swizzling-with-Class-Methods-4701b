This repository demonstrates a subtle but critical bug in Objective-C related to method swizzling. The bug arises when swizzling class methods in multiple classes with inheritance, where the order of swizzling operations significantly impacts the final outcome.  The `bug.m` file illustrates the problematic code, leading to unexpected behavior. The solution, shown in `bugSolution.m`, addresses this by carefully managing the order of swizzling and ensuring each class's intended behavior is correctly implemented.  This issue highlights the importance of meticulous planning and attention to detail when using method swizzling.
