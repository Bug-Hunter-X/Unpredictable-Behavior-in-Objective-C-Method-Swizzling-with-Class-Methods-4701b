In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with method swizzling.  The issue stems from improper handling of class methods and the order of swizzling.  Consider the scenario where you're swizzling a class method in two different classes, A and B, both inheriting from a base class C. If you perform the swizzling without considering the order of operations, the final behavior might be unpredictable, or you may even introduce crashes.  For example:

```objectivec
// Class A
+ (void)load {
    static dispatch_once_t onceToken;
dispatch_once(&onceToken, ^{ 
        Method originalMethod = class_getClassMethod([self class], @selector(originalMethod));
        Method swizzledMethod = class_getClassMethod([self class], @selector(swizzledMethod));
        method_exchangeImplementations(originalMethod, swizzledMethod);
    });
}

+ (void)originalMethod {
    NSLog(@"Original method in A");
}

+ (void)swizzledMethod {
    NSLog(@"Swizzled method in A");
}

// Class B
+ (void)load {
    static dispatch_once_t onceToken;
dispatch_once(&onceToken, ^{ 
        Method originalMethod = class_getClassMethod([self class], @selector(originalMethod));
        Method swizzledMethod = class_getClassMethod([self class], @selector(swizzledMethod));
        method_exchangeImplementations(originalMethod, swizzledMethod);
    });
}

+ (void)originalMethod {
    NSLog(@"Original method in B");
}

+ (void)swizzledMethod {
    NSLog(@"Swizzled method in B");
}
```

If A's `load` method executes before B's, B's swizzling might overwrite A's changes, leading to only B's swizzled method being active. This is because of the way method_exchangeImplementations works.
